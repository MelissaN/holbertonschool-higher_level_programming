## Python - Input/Output
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language:
> opening files and safely closing them using "with", writing and appending,
> reading entire file versus reading by lines, and importing and utilizing json

### Description of what each file shows:
* main_files ----- folder holds main programs to showcase examples of how to use functions
* Files that start with:
0. reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
1. function that returns the number of lines of a text file
2. function that reads n lines of text file; prints it to stdout
3. function that writes a str to text file; returns num of chars written
4. function that appends str to end of txt file; returns num of chars added
5. function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
6. function that returns an object (Python data structure) from JSON string
7. writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
8. creates an Object from a JSON file
9. script that adds all arguments to a Python list, thens save them to a file
10. returns the dictionary description with simple data structure ```obj.__dict__```
11. class Student that retrieves dictionary representation of student instance
12. build on #11 and return dictionary of attributes asked
13. build on #12 and transfer all of one instances attributes to another
14. [Pascal's triangle] - function that returns a list of lists of ints
15. 100- func searches for lines that contain specific str and inserts txt
16. 101- script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics
